3. Simple Data Model
-- Business Information
CREATE TABLE businesses (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    contact_email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    contact_phone VARCHAR(20),
    location TEXT,
    business_hours JSONB,  -- Store operating hours by day of week
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id)
);

-- Services offered by businesses
CREATE TABLE services (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    business_id UUID REFERENCES businesses(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    duration INTEGER NOT NULL,  -- Duration in minutes
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
);

-- Clients/Customers
CREATE TABLE clients (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(20),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id)  -- Optional: link to user account if they register
);

-- Appointments
CREATE TABLE appointments (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    business_id UUID REFERENCES businesses(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    service_id UUID REFERENCES services(id),
    client_id UUID REFERENCES clients(id),
    start_time TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    end_time TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'confirmed',  -- confirmed, cancelled, completed
    notes TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Authentication & Authorization (using Supabase)
-- This will be handled by Supabase Auth, but we'll need a users table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    role VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'client',  -- business, client, admin
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Time off / Unavailability
CREATE TABLE unavailable_times (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    business_id UUID REFERENCES businesses(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    start_time TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    end_time TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    reason VARCHAR(100)
);
4. Basic Workflow

Registration & Setup

Business owner registers and creates profile
Business owner adds services and sets availability


Client Booking Flow

Client browses businesses or searches by service type
Client selects a business and views available services
Client chooses a service and sees available time slots
Client selects time slot and provides contact information
System confirms booking and sends confirmation email


Appointment Management

Business owner receives notification of new booking
Both parties can view upcoming appointments
Either party can request cancellation/rescheduling
System sends reminders before appointment time



5. Frontend Technical Considerations (HTML, Alpine.js, TailwindCSS)

Use Alpine.js for reactive components like the booking calendar, service selection, and time slot picker
Use TailwindCSS for responsive design and consistent styling
Create modular components for reusability:

Calendar component
Service selection cards
Time slot picker
Appointment list
Notification components


Keep forms simple and user-friendly with clear validation
Implement a mobile-first design approach
Use local storage for caching when appropriate

6. Backend Technical Considerations (Python and Supabase)

Use Supabase for authentication, database, and real-time subscriptions
Create RESTful API endpoints using Python (with Flask or FastAPI)
Implement proper data validation and sanitization
Set up row-level security in Supabase for data protection
Use Supabase's real-time capabilities for immediate updates
Implement email notifications using a service like SendGrid
Create database functions and triggers for business logic
Implement proper error handling and logging
Use Supabase storage for business profile images
